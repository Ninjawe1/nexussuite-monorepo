⚡️ Base44 Ultimate App Prompt — “Esports Club Management System (Nexus Suite)”

Build a fully functional Esports Club Management System called Nexus Esports Suite, a complete SaaS platform that allows esports organizations and clubs to manage their entire operations — from rosters, payroll, analytics, and finances to marketing and communications (Marcom), matches, and contracts.
The platform will later be sold to other clubs as a subscription-based product, so it must be stable, optimized, and visually clean.

🏗️ 1. System Architecture

Multi-tenant SaaS app (each club = one tenant).

Secure role-based access (Owner, Admin, Manager, Staff, Player, Marcom, Analyst, Finance).

Every entity automatically linked to its tenant (no manual tenant_id input).

Authentication and authorization included.

Central dashboard overview with key insights (finance, analytics, active rosters, matches, campaigns, etc.).

👥 2. User & Staff Management

A Staff section where the club owner can:

Add, edit, and delete users/staff.

Assign roles and control access via checkboxes for each module (Payroll, Matches, Analytics, Marcom, Contracts, Settings, etc.).

Upload staff profile photos and contact info.

Fully functional CRUD (create, read, update, delete) with instant UI updates.

The owner can change permissions or suspend staff accounts anytime.

Activity logs recorded automatically.

🧾 3. Contracts Management

Upload and download contracts (PDF/DOCX) for players, staff, or sponsors.

Link contracts to the respective user or department.

Show expiration dates, renewal reminders, and contract types.

Store files securely and allow direct preview/download.

Contract uploads and edits are logged in the Audit Log.

💸 4. Payroll & Finance

Complete payroll system for both players and staff.

Each payment can be recurring (monthly/weekly/custom) or one-time.

Export payrolls to Excel or CSV.

Finance dashboard summarizing:

Total salaries

Revenues (sponsors, tournaments, content)

Profit/loss overview

Expected vs actual payments

Integrate categories like “Player Salaries,” “Staff Wages,” “Revenue from Tournaments,” etc.

📊 5. Analytics Dashboard

Track performance metrics such as:

Win/loss rates

Tournament placements

Player statistics

Content performance

Marcom campaign metrics

Visualize everything with charts and dynamic filters.

📅 6. Matches Management

Manage tournaments, scrims, and events.

Two views:

📣 7. Marcom Department

Dedicated Marcom section with:

Option to connect social media APIs (Twitter/X, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitch).

Automatically pull and display analytics from connected accounts (followers, reach, engagement, impressions).

Campaign analytics dashboard showing total campaigns, ROI, and performance.

Add campaign form must be functional and easy to use.

Marcom settings page for connecting and managing social API keys.

🧠 8. Audit Log

Fully functional audit system tracking every action:

When it was made

What was changed (old vs new value)

Covers all entities (users, payroll, matches, contracts, marcom, etc.).

Viewable by club owner or admin only.

🎨 9. Club Branding & Customization

Club owner can:

Upload a custom app icon and logo.

Change brand colors and theme (light/dark).

Changes apply globally and persist after reload.

Branding options stored per tenant.

💼 10. Subscription & Commercial Setup

App should support subscription-based access for clubs.

Each tenant (club) has isolated data and billing info.

Admin panel (super admin level) to manage all tenants and subscriptions.

⚙️ 11. System Reliability & Performance

All CRUD actions across the app (users, staff, contracts, matches, marcom, payroll) must work instantly — no stuck or pending requests.

UI automatically updates after any add/edit/delete.

Tenant_id automatically attached to all entities.

Data integrity and error handling built in.
