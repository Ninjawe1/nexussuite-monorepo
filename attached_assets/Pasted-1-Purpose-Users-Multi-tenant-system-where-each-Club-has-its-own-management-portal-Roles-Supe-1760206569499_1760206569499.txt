1) Purpose & Users

Multi-tenant system where each Club has its own management portal.

Roles:

Super Admin / App Owner (me — developer): full control, can create/delete/suspend clubs and staff, view analytics, manage subscriptions.

Club Owner: manages staff, teams, club-level settings, invites staff.

Club Staff: role-based access to club management features (content, tournaments, calendar, marcom).

Public users: subscribe or view public pages (marketing site).

2) Core Functional Requirements (must be fully functional)
Authentication & User Lifecycle

Custom branded login page hosted on the app (not Replit auth UI).

Support Google OAuth 2.0 (Sign in with Google) + classic email/password.

Invite flow:

Club Owner adds staff email → system sends invite email.

Email contains secure token link (single-use, expires e.g., 72 hours).

Follow link → complete registration (choose password or continue with Google).

After successful registration, staff is attached to that club with assigned role.

Super Admin has separate credentials and a dedicated Super Admin dashboard.

Provide endpoints for: sign-up, sign-in, token refresh, password reset, invite accept, revoke invite, lock/unlock user.

Multi-tenant Club Management

Super Admin can create/delete/suspend clubs and see all clubs.

When creating a club, generate a distinct management namespace (tenant_id).

Club Owner management: create staff, assign roles, set club settings, view club analytics.

Each staff must only access their club’s data; enforce tenant isolation in DB and APIs.

Dashboard & UI

Super Admin dashboard: create clubs, list clubs, view staff lists per club, suspend/delete staff/clubs, view billing and subscription status.

Club dashboard: staff roster, upcoming tournaments, calendar, marcom analytics panel with realtime metrics, content manager.

Each club must have a login column / unique login path to their management console.

Calendar

Fix: Calendar view must work (month/week/day) and be interactive.

Calendar must support:

Events assigned to teams/staff.

Drag & drop rescheduling.

Internal deadlines and external published events.

Conflict detection and alerts.

Sync with Google Calendar (2-way if possible) — include OAuth scopes and webhook handling.

Provide a checklist of common failures and resolution steps (see debug checklist below).

Social Media Connections & Real-time Analytics (MarCom page)

Support connectors for: Twitter/X, Facebook Pages, Instagram (Graph API), YouTube, Twitch (minimum).

OAuth-based connectors per platform; store tokens encrypted with rotation plan.

Real-time analytics on MarCom page:

Show live metrics (impressions, engagement, follower growth, recent posts).

Use webhooks where available (e.g., YouTube/Twitch/IG webhooks) for immediate updates; fall back to scheduled polling with incremental diffs.

Display time-series charts for last 7/30/90 days.

Enable historical export (CSV).

Provide a connector management UI (connect/disconnect/refresh tokens).

Include rate-limit handling and backoff strategy.

Subscriptions & Payments

Use Stripe (recommended) for subscription management:

Plans: Starter, Growth, Enterprise (billing interval monthly/annual).

Ability to attach subscription to Club entity.

Webhook handlers for invoice.payment_succeeded, invoice.payment_failed, customer.subscription.updated, customer.subscription.deleted.

Trial period support and promo codes.

Super Admin can view billing dashboard and manually change plan or suspend club access on payment failure.

Super Admin / App Owner Privileges

Create new clubs, define plan, provision initial Club Owner.

View and manage all staff across all clubs (search, filter).

Force-deactivate users, reassign or delete staff.

View global logs and system health (integrations, recent webhook failures).
